# Overview
In this tutorial, we will implement the K Means algorithm and Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) from scratch. For each, there is a Jupyter notebook providing a plain English, non-mathematical introduction to the topic. A second notebook includes the mathematical details, and a final notebook implements the code step by step. A .py file contains the complete implementation.
